					<p>After the fall of Bahamani kingdom, Deccan became very unstable on the political front. Five major principalities that sprang up were constantly engaged in war against each other or the Mughals. This was a very tormenting period for local people.</p>

					<p>The devastating famine of 1630 CE has been amply described in contemporary sources. Nizamshahi was at the end of it's life. While Shahji tried to revive Nizamshahi, he did not get enough support.</p>

					<p>Three years of plundering by the Mughal army had devastated the economy in Shivaji's region. He had to rejuvenate it by getting funds from enemy camp. Surat was one such wealthy city with huge revenues and little protection</p>

					<p>On the behest of Jaisingh, Shivaji decided to visit the Mughal Emperor at Agra. But his first encounter with the Emperor turned into a confrontation of sorts. He was hardly welcomed at the court and was made to stand behind officers who used to run away from the battlefield. </p>

					<p>After several attempts to open trade with a powerful ruler of India failed in the earliest years of the 1600s, King James I of England sent a personal envoy, Sir Thomas Roe, to the court of the Mogul emperor Jahangir in 1614.</p>

					<p>The Mogul Empire was in a state of collapse by the 1720s. Other European powers were competing for control in India, and sought alliances with the shaky states that inherited the Mogul territories.

						The East India Company established its own army in India, which was composed of British troops as well as native soldiers called sepoys.</p>

					<p>The traditional story is that Indian troops, called sepoys, mutinied against their British commanders because newly issued rifle cartridges were greased with pig and cow fat, thus making them unacceptable for both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. There is some truth to that, but there were a number of other underlying causes for the rebellion.</p>
